				<h1>Halloween Costumes</h1>
				<p>The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain.
				<br>
				<br>
				Today we view these costumes as Halloween classics and often associate them with the holiday </p>
